# Home Assistant integration for Unisenza Plus

Unisenza Plus is an IoT family that connects smart thermostats and other devices
manufactured by [Purmo](https://global.purmo.com/>) to a cloud service via the
Unisenza Plus Gateway.

This integration exposes the smart thermostats controlled via the cloud service
as [climate entities](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/climate/). The
integration only supports smart thermostats at the time being.

## Disclaimer

The integration is still in early stages, experimental, and lacks
documentation. If you don't mind that, feel free to try it out, and give
feedback on how it went!

The author of this integration is not affiliated with Purmo, the vendor of
Unisenza Plus, in any way. The integration and its conformance to the Unisenza
Plus API is implemented on a best-effort basis. No warranty of any kind is
provided.
